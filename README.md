# Visualizing Prediction and Correlation
Data analysis to estimate the state of the existing data according to the desired category.

## Background Problem
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
what sorts of people were more likely to survive?

## Steps in this project :

### Libraries
1. pandas
2. matplotlib
3. seaborn

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understanding dataset
- view summary statistic dataset

### Feature Engineering
- Checking & Handling missing values
- Checking & Handling Duplicated Data
- Making Sure Complete Dataset

### Visualizing the Prediction
Visualizing what has been predicted on the dataset, this prediction is divided into several categories, namely :

1. Visualizing the distribution of Age
2. Visualizing the distribution of Fare
3. Visualizing the distribution of Survived
4. Survival rates based on Sex
5. Survival rates based on Pclass
6. Survival rates based on Embarked
7. Box Plot for Numerical Features

### Plot the Correlation between each categories
 to determine the correlation between variables in a data set. This heatmap can help identify variables that are strongly correlated or contradictory.

 ## Insight 
know more clearly what categories or types of people have survived in relation to existing data.
analyzing by finding out whether there is a relationship between each category to see and become an insight that in the future it can be an evaluation of categories with these related variables that have a better chance of surviving.
